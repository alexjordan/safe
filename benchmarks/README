In order to reproduce the experiments of the paper:

  "Combining String Abstract Domains for JavaScript Analysis: An Evaluation"

you need to have the proper version of SAFE installed and:

1. Generate a list of jobs of the form "name|domain|size" (the make_jobs_list
   script will help you) and redirect the list of jobs to a corresponding file,
   let us say <JOBS_LIST>

2. Run the script run_jobs, which analyses each program of <JOBS_LIST> and, at
   the end of its execution, moves the logs of the results (in .txt format) into
   a result directory, let us say <RESULTS_DIR>.
   run_jobs relies on analyze_strdom_param.sh script, which in turn uses the 
   script analyze.inc.sh for analysing a single program

3. Once the logs of the results are moved into <RESULTS_DIR>, we can extract the
   corresponding .csv files with results2csv script, which in turn uses the
   logs2csv.py script.
   From the .csv files one can use the stript csv2stats for generating the 
   statistics of the analysis.

Note that you need to modify the input/output variables of such scripts in order
to properly run them on your machine.
